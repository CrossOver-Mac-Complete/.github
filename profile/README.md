## Overview

CrossOver Mac delivers professional Windows application <a href="#">compatibility layer</a> for Mac through native application architecture optimized for macOS environments. The software operates efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon processors through universal binary compilation, ensuring optimal performance regardless of Mac hardware generation while maintaining consistent feature availability across all processor architectures.

Deep system integration enables CrossOver to leverage macOS capabilities including Quick Look previews for supported file formats, Spotlight indexing enabling system-wide search of application content, and Services menu integration providing functionality accessible from other applications. The application handles multi-display configurations intelligently, remembering window positions and adapting interface layouts appropriate for each connected monitor resolution.

Customization capabilities provide extensive control over interface appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and workflow preferences without overwhelming new users.
